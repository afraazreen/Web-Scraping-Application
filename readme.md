# Web Scraping Application

This is a web-scraping assignment, in which we scrape the details from the specified website in order to create a console-based application which displays all this information to the user.

## Option 1:
We scrape the details from the designated website and this is displayed in a neatly formatted manner to the user, so that the user is able to understand all the information we provide them correctly. We also print the total details at the end of the website. 

## Option 2:
We are analyzing the deals. This is done by category, whereby the user is presented with a list of categories, that allow the user to understand how many deals are available and essentially presents a larger overview of the deals by category.

## Option 3:
We provide the user with the ability to find the top stores. Once the input is provided, the system analyzes the dataset, identifying and presenting top stores based on the number of deals associated with
each store. It allows for more personalized and targetted analysis.

## Option 4:
The user is first given all of the category information, and then, the program takes in the users chosen categories, eventually, the program identifies and logs all the deal links within the selected category to a file named 'log.txt'. 

## Option 5
When the user presses the option 5, we trigger the exit call, making the program terminate. 

Overall, this program is a console based web-scraping tool which allows us to access data from users and accurately display information regarding deals from the designated website.
